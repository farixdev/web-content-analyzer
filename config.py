"""
Tiny .env loader (no dependencies).

Reads KEY=VALUE lines from a ".env" file next to this module (and the current
working directory) into os.environ, so API keys are entered once in a file and
picked up on every launch. Real environment variables always win over the file.

Supported .env syntax:
  KEY=value
  KEY="value with spaces"
  export KEY=value        # leading "export " is ignored
  # comment lines and blank lines are skipped
